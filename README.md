### todo
 - experiment

### v2 (2024-11-07)
 - split organisms into herbivores and carnivores
    - herbivores (blue) eat only agar (previously referred to as food)
    - carnivores (red) eat herbivores
 - changed sight from entity count to total color
 - neural networks expanded to handle new inputs
 - speed is now based off of neural network brain and logistic growth curve

### v1.1
 - added hunger
 - optimized neural network math

### v1 (2024-11-06)
 - organisms
    - added sight
    - added neural network processing
    - added eating functionality
